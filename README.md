# Programming Ability Test Solutions(Advanced Level)
## Introduce
[Programming Ability Test (abbr. PAT)](https://github.com/RunningIkkyu/PAT) aims to objectively evaluate the algorithm design and program implementation ability of the examinee through the unified organization online judgement and automatic judgement method, scientifically evaluate the computer programming talents, and provide a reference standard for the enterprises to select talents.
## Solution
This project is a set of my solutions of PAT problems, and all programs could pass the Online Judgement in C++.
